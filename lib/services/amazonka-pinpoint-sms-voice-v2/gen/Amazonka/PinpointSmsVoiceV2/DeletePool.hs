-- Deletes an existing pool. Deleting a pool disassociates all origination
-- identities from that pool.
--
-- If the pool status isn\'t active or if deletion protection is enabled,
-- an Error is returned.
--
-- A pool is a collection of phone numbers and SenderIds. A pool can
-- include one or more phone numbers and SenderIds that are associated with
-- your Amazon Web Services account.
