-- Determines the details for the room from which a skill request was
-- invoked. This operation is used by skill developers.
--
-- To query ResolveRoom from an Alexa skill, the skill ID needs to be
-- authorized. When the skill is using an AWS Lambda function, the skill is
-- automatically authorized when you publish your skill as a private skill
-- to your AWS account. Skills that are hosted using a custom web service
-- must be manually authorized. To get your skill authorized, contact AWS
-- Support with your AWS account ID that queries the ResolveRoom API and
-- skill ID.
