-- Deletes an existing replication group. By default, this operation
-- deletes the entire replication group, including the primary\/primaries
-- and all of the read replicas. If the replication group has only one
-- primary, you can optionally delete only the read replicas, while
-- retaining the primary by setting @RetainPrimaryCluster=true@.
--
-- When you receive a successful response from this operation, Amazon
-- ElastiCache immediately begins deleting the selected resources; you
-- cannot cancel or revert this operation.
--
-- This operation is valid for Redis only.
