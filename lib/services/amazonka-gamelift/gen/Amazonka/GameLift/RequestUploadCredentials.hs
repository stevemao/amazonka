-- Retrieves a fresh set of credentials for use when uploading a new set of
-- game build files to Amazon GameLift\'s Amazon S3. This is done as part
-- of the build creation process; see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_CreateBuild.html GameSession>.
--
-- To request new credentials, specify the build ID as returned with an
-- initial @CreateBuild@ request. If successful, a new set of credentials
-- are returned, along with the S3 storage location associated with the
-- build ID.
