-- Deletes a file system, permanently severing access to its contents. Upon
-- return, the file system no longer exists and you can\'t access any
-- contents of the deleted file system.
--
-- You need to manually delete mount targets attached to a file system
-- before you can delete an EFS file system. This step is performed for you
-- when you use the Amazon Web Services console to delete a file system.
--
-- You cannot delete a file system that is part of an EFS Replication
-- configuration. You need to delete the replication configuration first.
--
-- You can\'t delete a file system that is in use. That is, if the file
-- system has any mount targets, you must first delete them. For more
-- information, see DescribeMountTargets and DeleteMountTarget.
--
-- The @DeleteFileSystem@ call returns while the file system state is still
-- @deleting@. You can check the file system deletion status by calling the
-- DescribeFileSystems operation, which returns a list of file systems in
-- your account. If you pass file system ID or creation token for the
-- deleted file system, the DescribeFileSystems returns a
-- @404 FileSystemNotFound@ error.
--
-- This operation requires permissions for the
-- @elasticfilesystem:DeleteFileSystem@ action.
