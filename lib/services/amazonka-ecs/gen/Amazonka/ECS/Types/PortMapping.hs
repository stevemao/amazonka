-- | Port mappings allow containers to access ports on the host container
-- instance to send or receive traffic. Port mappings are specified as part
-- of the container definition.
--
-- If you use containers in a task with the @awsvpc@ or @host@ network
-- mode, specify the exposed ports using @containerPort@. The @hostPort@
-- can be left blank or it must be the same value as the @containerPort@.
--
-- You can\'t expose the same container port for multiple protocols. If you
-- attempt this, an error is returned.
--
-- After a task reaches the @RUNNING@ status, manual and automatic host and
-- container port assignments are visible in the @networkBindings@ section
-- of DescribeTasks API responses.
