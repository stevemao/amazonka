-- Creates a continuous deployment policy that distributes traffic for a
-- custom domain name to two different CloudFront distributions.
--
-- To use a continuous deployment policy, first use @CopyDistribution@ to
-- create a staging distribution, then use @UpdateDistribution@ to modify
-- the staging distribution’s configuration.
--
-- After you create and update a staging distribution, you can use a
-- continuous deployment policy to incrementally move traffic to the
-- staging distribution. This workflow enables you to test changes to a
-- distribution’s configuration before moving all of your domain’s
-- production traffic to the new configuration.
