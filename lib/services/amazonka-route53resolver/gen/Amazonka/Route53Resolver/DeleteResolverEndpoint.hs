-- Deletes a Resolver endpoint. The effect of deleting a Resolver endpoint
-- depends on whether it\'s an inbound or an outbound Resolver endpoint:
--
-- -   __Inbound__: DNS queries from your network are no longer routed to
--     the DNS service for the specified VPC.
--
-- -   __Outbound__: DNS queries from a VPC are no longer routed to your
--     network.
