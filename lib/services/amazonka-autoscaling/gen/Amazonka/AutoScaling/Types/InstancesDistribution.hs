    --     Uses price to determine which instance types are the highest

    --
    -- [prioritized]
    --     You set the order of instance types for the launch template
    --     overrides from highest to lowest priority (from first to last in the
    --     list). Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches your highest priority

    --     fulfilled using your highest priority instance type, then Amazon EC2
    --     Auto Scaling launches the remaining capacity using the second
    --     priority instance type, and so on. This is the default value for
    --     Auto Scaling groups that don\'t specify InstanceRequirements and
    --     cannot be used for groups that do.
    onDemandAllocationStrategy :: Prelude.Maybe Prelude.Text,
    -- | The minimum amount of the Auto Scaling group\'s capacity that must be
    -- fulfilled by On-Demand Instances. This base portion is launched first as

    onDemandBaseCapacity :: Prelude.Maybe Prelude.Int,
    -- | Controls the percentages of On-Demand Instances and Spot Instances for
    -- your additional capacity beyond @OnDemandBaseCapacity@. Expressed as a

    -- [capacity-optimized]
    --     Requests Spot Instances using pools that are optimally chosen based
    --     on the available Spot capacity. This strategy has the lowest risk of

    --     You set the order of instance types for the launch template

    --     if the On-Demand allocation strategy is set to @prioritized@, the
    --     same priority is applied when fulfilling On-Demand capacity. This is
    --     not a valid value for Auto Scaling groups that specify
    --     InstanceRequirements.
    --
    -- [lowest-price]
    --     Requests Spot Instances using the lowest priced pools within an
    --     Availability Zone, across the number of Spot pools that you specify
    --     for the @SpotInstancePools@ property. To ensure that your desired
    --     capacity is met, you might receive Spot Instances from several
    --     pools. This is the default value, but it might lead to high
    --     interruption rates because this strategy only considers instance
    --     price and not available capacity.
    --
    -- [price-capacity-optimized (recommended)]

    --     price and capacity to select the Spot Instance pools that are the
