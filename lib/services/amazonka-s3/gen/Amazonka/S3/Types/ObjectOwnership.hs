-- | The container element for object ownership for a bucket\'s ownership
-- controls.
--
-- BucketOwnerPreferred - Objects uploaded to the bucket change ownership
-- to the bucket owner if the objects are uploaded with the
-- @bucket-owner-full-control@ canned ACL.
--
-- ObjectWriter - The uploading account will own the object if the object
-- is uploaded with the @bucket-owner-full-control@ canned ACL.
--
-- BucketOwnerEnforced - Access control lists (ACLs) are disabled and no
-- longer affect permissions. The bucket owner automatically owns and has
-- full control over every object in the bucket. The bucket only accepts
-- PUT requests that don\'t specify an ACL or bucket owner full control
-- ACLs, such as the @bucket-owner-full-control@ canned ACL or an
-- equivalent form of this ACL expressed in the XML format.
