-- Describes the given campaign, including its status.
--
-- A campaign can be in one of the following states:
--
-- -   CREATE PENDING > CREATE IN_PROGRESS > ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED
--
-- -   DELETE PENDING > DELETE IN_PROGRESS
--
-- When the @status@ is @CREATE FAILED@, the response includes the
-- @failureReason@ key, which describes why.
