-- Deletes the resource-based policy attached to a private CA. Deletion
-- will remove any access that the policy has granted. If there is no
-- policy attached to the private CA, this action will return successful.
--
-- If you delete a policy that was applied through Amazon Web Services
-- Resource Access Manager (RAM), the CA will be removed from all shares in
-- which it was included.
--
-- The Certificate Manager Service Linked Role that the policy supports is
-- not affected when you delete the policy.
--
-- The current policy can be shown with
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/API_GetPolicy.html GetPolicy>
-- and updated with
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/API_PutPolicy.html PutPolicy>.
--
-- __About Policies__
--
-- -   A policy grants access on a private CA to an Amazon Web Services
--     customer account, to Amazon Web Services Organizations, or to an
--     Amazon Web Services Organizations unit. Policies are under the
--     control of a CA administrator. For more information, see
--     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/userguide/pca-rbp.html Using a Resource Based Policy with ACM Private CA>.
--
-- -   A policy permits a user of Certificate Manager (ACM) to issue ACM
--     certificates signed by a CA in another account.
--
-- -   For ACM to manage automatic renewal of these certificates, the ACM
--     user must configure a Service Linked Role (SLR). The SLR allows the
--     ACM service to assume the identity of the user, subject to
--     confirmation against the ACM Private CA policy. For more
--     information, see
--     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-slr.html Using a Service Linked Role with ACM>.
--
-- -   Updates made in Amazon Web Services Resource Manager (RAM) are
--     reflected in policies. For more information, see
--     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/userguide/pca-ram.html Attach a Policy for Cross-Account Access>.
