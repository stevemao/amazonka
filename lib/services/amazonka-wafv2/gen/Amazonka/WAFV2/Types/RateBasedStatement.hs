-- | A rate-based rule tracks the rate of requests for each originating IP
-- address, and triggers the rule action when the rate exceeds a limit that
-- you specify on the number of requests in any 5-minute time span. You can
-- use this to put a temporary block on requests from an IP address that is
-- sending excessive requests.
--
-- WAF tracks and manages web requests separately for each instance of a
-- rate-based rule that you use. For example, if you provide the same
-- rate-based rule settings in two web ACLs, each of the two rule
-- statements represents a separate instance of the rate-based rule and
-- gets its own tracking and management by WAF. If you define a rate-based
-- rule inside a rule group, and then use that rule group in multiple
-- places, each use creates a separate instance of the rate-based rule that
-- gets its own tracking and management by WAF.
--
-- When the rule action triggers, WAF blocks additional requests from the
-- IP address until the request rate falls below the limit.
--
-- You can optionally nest another statement inside the rate-based
-- statement, to narrow the scope of the rule so that it only counts
-- requests that match the nested statement. For example, based on recent
-- requests that you have seen from an attacker, you might create a
-- rate-based rule with a nested AND rule statement that contains the
-- following nested statements:
--
-- -   An IP match statement with an IP set that specified the address
--     192.0.2.44.
--
-- -   A string match statement that searches in the User-Agent header for
--     the string BadBot.
--
-- In this rate-based rule, you also define a rate limit. For this example,
-- the rate limit is 1,000. Requests that meet the criteria of both of the
-- nested statements are counted. If the count exceeds 1,000 requests per
-- five minutes, the rule action triggers. Requests that do not meet the
-- criteria of both of the nested statements are not counted towards the
-- rate limit and are not affected by this rule.
--
-- You cannot nest a @RateBasedStatement@ inside another statement, for
-- example inside a @NotStatement@ or @OrStatement@. You can define a
-- @RateBasedStatement@ inside a web ACL and inside a rule group.
--
-- /See:/ 'newRateBasedStatement' smart constructor.
