    andStatement :: Prelude.Maybe AndStatement,
    -- | A rule statement that defines a string match search for WAF to apply to
    -- web requests. The byte match statement provides the bytes to search for,
    -- the location in requests that you want WAF to search, and other
    -- settings. The bytes to search for are typically a string that
    -- corresponds with ASCII characters. In the WAF console and the developer
    -- guide, this is called a string match statement.
    byteMatchStatement :: Prelude.Maybe ByteMatchStatement,
    -- | A rule statement that labels web requests by country and region and that
    -- matches against web requests based on country code. A geo match rule
    -- labels every request that it inspects regardless of whether it finds a
    -- match.
    --
    -- -   To manage requests only by country, you can use this statement by
    --     itself and specify the countries that you want to match against in
    --     the @CountryCodes@ array.
    --
    -- -   Otherwise, configure your geo match rule with Count action so that
    --     it only labels requests. Then, add one or more label match rules to
    --     run after the geo match rule and configure them to match against the
    --     geographic labels and handle the requests as needed.
    --
    -- WAF labels requests using the alpha-2 country and region codes from the
    -- International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 3166 standard. WAF
    -- determines the codes using either the IP address in the web request
    -- origin or, if you specify it, the address in the geo match
    -- @ForwardedIPConfig@.
    --
    -- If you use the web request origin, the label formats are
    -- @awswaf:clientip:geo:region:\<ISO country code>-\<ISO region code>@ and

    geoMatchStatement :: Prelude.Maybe GeoMatchStatement,
    -- | A rule statement used to detect web requests coming from particular IP
    -- addresses or address ranges. To use this, create an IPSet that specifies
    -- the addresses you want to detect, then use the ARN of that set in this
    -- statement. To create an IP set, see CreateIPSet.
    --
    -- Each IP set rule statement references an IP set. You create and maintain
    -- the set independent of your rules. This allows you to use the single set
    -- in multiple rules. When you update the referenced set, WAF automatically
    -- updates all rules that reference it.
    iPSetReferenceStatement :: Prelude.Maybe IPSetReferenceStatement,
    -- | A rule statement to match against labels that have been added to the web
    -- request by rules that have already run in the web ACL.
    --
    -- The label match statement provides the label or namespace string to
    -- search for. The label string can represent a part or all of the fully
    -- qualified label name that had been added to the web request. Fully
    -- qualified labels have a prefix, optional namespaces, and label name. The
    -- prefix identifies the rule group or web ACL context of the rule that
    -- added the label. If you do not provide the fully qualified name in your
    -- label match string, WAF performs the search for labels that were added
    -- in the same context as the label match statement.
    labelMatchStatement :: Prelude.Maybe LabelMatchStatement,
    -- | A rule statement used to run the rules that are defined in a managed
    -- rule group. To use this, provide the vendor name and the name of the
    -- rule group in this statement. You can retrieve the required names by
    -- calling ListAvailableManagedRuleGroups.
    --
    -- You cannot nest a @ManagedRuleGroupStatement@, for example for use
    -- inside a @NotStatement@ or @OrStatement@. It can only be referenced as a
    -- top-level statement within a rule.
    --
    -- You are charged additional fees when you use the WAF Bot Control managed
    -- rule group @AWSManagedRulesBotControlRuleSet@ or the WAF Fraud Control
    -- account takeover prevention (ATP) managed rule group
    -- @AWSManagedRulesATPRuleSet@. For more information, see
    -- <http://aws.amazon.com/waf/pricing/ WAF Pricing>.
    managedRuleGroupStatement :: Prelude.Maybe ManagedRuleGroupStatement,
    -- | A logical rule statement used to negate the results of another rule
    -- statement. You provide one Statement within the @NotStatement@.
    notStatement :: Prelude.Maybe NotStatement,
    -- | A logical rule statement used to combine other rule statements with OR
    -- logic. You provide more than one Statement within the @OrStatement@.
    orStatement :: Prelude.Maybe OrStatement,
    -- | A rate-based rule tracks the rate of requests for each originating IP
    -- address, and triggers the rule action when the rate exceeds a limit that
    -- you specify on the number of requests in any 5-minute time span. You can
    -- use this to put a temporary block on requests from an IP address that is
    -- sending excessive requests.
    --
    -- WAF tracks and manages web requests separately for each instance of a
    -- rate-based rule that you use. For example, if you provide the same
    -- rate-based rule settings in two web ACLs, each of the two rule
    -- statements represents a separate instance of the rate-based rule and
    -- gets its own tracking and management by WAF. If you define a rate-based
    -- rule inside a rule group, and then use that rule group in multiple
    -- places, each use creates a separate instance of the rate-based rule that
    -- gets its own tracking and management by WAF.
    --
    -- When the rule action triggers, WAF blocks additional requests from the
    -- IP address until the request rate falls below the limit.
    --
    -- You can optionally nest another statement inside the rate-based
    -- statement, to narrow the scope of the rule so that it only counts
    -- requests that match the nested statement. For example, based on recent
    -- requests that you have seen from an attacker, you might create a
    -- rate-based rule with a nested AND rule statement that contains the
    -- following nested statements:
    --
    -- -   An IP match statement with an IP set that specified the address
    --     192.0.2.44.
    --
    -- -   A string match statement that searches in the User-Agent header for
    --     the string BadBot.
    --
    -- In this rate-based rule, you also define a rate limit. For this example,
    -- the rate limit is 1,000. Requests that meet the criteria of both of the
    -- nested statements are counted. If the count exceeds 1,000 requests per
    -- five minutes, the rule action triggers. Requests that do not meet the
    -- criteria of both of the nested statements are not counted towards the
    -- rate limit and are not affected by this rule.
    --
    -- You cannot nest a @RateBasedStatement@ inside another statement, for
    -- example inside a @NotStatement@ or @OrStatement@. You can define a
    -- @RateBasedStatement@ inside a web ACL and inside a rule group.
    rateBasedStatement :: Prelude.Maybe RateBasedStatement,
    -- | A rule statement used to search web request components for a match
    -- against a single regular expression.
    regexMatchStatement :: Prelude.Maybe RegexMatchStatement,
    -- | A rule statement used to search web request components for matches with
    -- regular expressions. To use this, create a RegexPatternSet that
    -- specifies the expressions that you want to detect, then use the ARN of
    -- that set in this statement. A web request matches the pattern set rule
    -- statement if the request component matches any of the patterns in the
    -- set. To create a regex pattern set, see CreateRegexPatternSet.
    --
    -- Each regex pattern set rule statement references a regex pattern set.
    -- You create and maintain the set independent of your rules. This allows
    -- you to use the single set in multiple rules. When you update the
    -- referenced set, WAF automatically updates all rules that reference it.
    regexPatternSetReferenceStatement :: Prelude.Maybe RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement,
    -- | A rule statement used to run the rules that are defined in a RuleGroup.
    -- To use this, create a rule group with your rules, then provide the ARN
    -- of the rule group in this statement.
    --
    -- You cannot nest a @RuleGroupReferenceStatement@, for example for use
    -- inside a @NotStatement@ or @OrStatement@. You can only use a rule group
    -- reference statement at the top level inside a web ACL.
    ruleGroupReferenceStatement :: Prelude.Maybe RuleGroupReferenceStatement,
    -- | A rule statement that compares a number of bytes against the size of a
    -- request component, using a comparison operator, such as greater than (>)
    -- or less than (\<). For example, you can use a size constraint statement
    -- to look for query strings that are longer than 100 bytes.
    --
    -- If you configure WAF to inspect the request body, WAF inspects only the
    -- first 8192 bytes (8 KB). If the request body for your web requests never
    -- exceeds 8192 bytes, you could use a size constraint statement to block
    -- requests that have a request body greater than 8192 bytes.
    --
    -- If you choose URI for the value of Part of the request to filter on, the
    -- slash (\/) in the URI counts as one character. For example, the URI
    -- @\/logo.jpg@ is nine characters long.
    sizeConstraintStatement :: Prelude.Maybe SizeConstraintStatement,
    -- | A rule statement that inspects for malicious SQL code. Attackers insert
    -- malicious SQL code into web requests to do things like modify your
    -- database or extract data from it.
    sqliMatchStatement :: Prelude.Maybe SqliMatchStatement,
    -- | A rule statement that inspects for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
    -- In XSS attacks, the attacker uses vulnerabilities in a benign website as
    -- a vehicle to inject malicious client-site scripts into other legitimate
    -- web browsers.

-- | A logical rule statement used to negate the results of another rule
-- statement. You provide one Statement within the @NotStatement@.
statement_notStatement :: Lens.Lens' Statement (Prelude.Maybe NotStatement)
statement_notStatement = Lens.lens (\Statement' {notStatement} -> notStatement) (\s@Statement' {} a -> s {notStatement = a} :: Statement)

-- | A logical rule statement used to combine other rule statements with OR
-- logic. You provide more than one Statement within the @OrStatement@.

statement_orStatement = Lens.lens (\Statement' {orStatement} -> orStatement) (\s@Statement' {} a -> s {orStatement = a} :: Statement)

-- | A rate-based rule tracks the rate of requests for each originating IP
-- address, and triggers the rule action when the rate exceeds a limit that
-- you specify on the number of requests in any 5-minute time span. You can
-- use this to put a temporary block on requests from an IP address that is
-- sending excessive requests.
--
-- WAF tracks and manages web requests separately for each instance of a
-- rate-based rule that you use. For example, if you provide the same
-- rate-based rule settings in two web ACLs, each of the two rule
-- statements represents a separate instance of the rate-based rule and
-- gets its own tracking and management by WAF. If you define a rate-based
-- rule inside a rule group, and then use that rule group in multiple
-- places, each use creates a separate instance of the rate-based rule that
-- gets its own tracking and management by WAF.
--
-- When the rule action triggers, WAF blocks additional requests from the
-- IP address until the request rate falls below the limit.
--
-- You can optionally nest another statement inside the rate-based
-- statement, to narrow the scope of the rule so that it only counts
-- requests that match the nested statement. For example, based on recent
-- requests that you have seen from an attacker, you might create a
-- rate-based rule with a nested AND rule statement that contains the
-- following nested statements:
--
-- -   An IP match statement with an IP set that specified the address
--     192.0.2.44.
--
-- -   A string match statement that searches in the User-Agent header for
--     the string BadBot.
--
-- In this rate-based rule, you also define a rate limit. For this example,
-- the rate limit is 1,000. Requests that meet the criteria of both of the
-- nested statements are counted. If the count exceeds 1,000 requests per
-- five minutes, the rule action triggers. Requests that do not meet the
-- criteria of both of the nested statements are not counted towards the
-- rate limit and are not affected by this rule.
--
-- You cannot nest a @RateBasedStatement@ inside another statement, for
-- example inside a @NotStatement@ or @OrStatement@. You can define a
-- @RateBasedStatement@ inside a web ACL and inside a rule group.

-- | A rule statement used to search web request components for matches with
-- regular expressions. To use this, create a RegexPatternSet that
-- specifies the expressions that you want to detect, then use the ARN of
-- that set in this statement. A web request matches the pattern set rule
-- statement if the request component matches any of the patterns in the
-- set. To create a regex pattern set, see CreateRegexPatternSet.
--
-- Each regex pattern set rule statement references a regex pattern set.
-- You create and maintain the set independent of your rules. This allows
-- you to use the single set in multiple rules. When you update the
-- referenced set, WAF automatically updates all rules that reference it.

-- | A rule statement used to run the rules that are defined in a RuleGroup.
-- To use this, create a rule group with your rules, then provide the ARN
-- of the rule group in this statement.
--
-- You cannot nest a @RuleGroupReferenceStatement@, for example for use
-- inside a @NotStatement@ or @OrStatement@. You can only use a rule group
-- reference statement at the top level inside a web ACL.
statement_ruleGroupReferenceStatement :: Lens.Lens' Statement (Prelude.Maybe RuleGroupReferenceStatement)
statement_ruleGroupReferenceStatement = Lens.lens (\Statement' {ruleGroupReferenceStatement} -> ruleGroupReferenceStatement) (\s@Statement' {} a -> s {ruleGroupReferenceStatement = a} :: Statement)

-- | A rule statement that compares a number of bytes against the size of a
-- request component, using a comparison operator, such as greater than (>)
-- or less than (\<). For example, you can use a size constraint statement
-- to look for query strings that are longer than 100 bytes.
--
-- If you configure WAF to inspect the request body, WAF inspects only the
-- first 8192 bytes (8 KB). If the request body for your web requests never
-- exceeds 8192 bytes, you could use a size constraint statement to block
-- requests that have a request body greater than 8192 bytes.
--
-- If you choose URI for the value of Part of the request to filter on, the
-- slash (\/) in the URI counts as one character. For example, the URI
-- @\/logo.jpg@ is nine characters long.
