-- Deletes a deployment. To delete an active deployment, you must first
-- cancel it. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/apireference/API_CancelDeployment.html CancelDeployment>.

-- Deleting a deployment doesn\'t affect core devices that run that
-- deployment, because core devices store the deployment\'s configuration
-- on the device. Additionally, core devices can roll back to a previous
-- deployment that has been deleted.
