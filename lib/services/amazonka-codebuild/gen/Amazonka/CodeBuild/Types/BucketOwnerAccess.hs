-- | Specifies the bucket owner\'s access for objects that another account
-- uploads to their Amazon S3 bucket. By default, only the account that
-- uploads the objects to the bucket has access to these objects. This
-- property allows you to give the bucket owner access to these objects.
--
-- To use this property, your CodeBuild service role must have the
-- @s3:PutBucketAcl@ permission. This permission allows CodeBuild to modify
-- the access control list for the bucket.
--
-- This property can be one of the following values:
--
-- [NONE]
--     The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is the
--     default.
--
-- [READ_ONLY]
--     The bucket owner has read-only access to the objects. The uploading
--     account retains ownership of the objects.
--
-- [FULL]
--     The bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object ownership is
--     determined by the following criteria:
--
--     -   If the bucket is configured with the __Bucket owner preferred__
--         setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading
--         account will have object access as specified by the bucket\'s
--         policy.
--
--     -   Otherwise, the uploading account retains ownership of the
--         objects.
--
--     For more information about Amazon S3 object ownership, see
--     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html Controlling ownership of uploaded objects using S3 Object Ownership>
--     in the /Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide/.
