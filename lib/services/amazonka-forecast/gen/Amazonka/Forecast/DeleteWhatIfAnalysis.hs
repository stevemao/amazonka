-- Deletes a what-if analysis created using the CreateWhatIfAnalysis
-- operation. You can delete only what-if analyses that have a status of
-- @ACTIVE@ or @CREATE_FAILED@. To get the status, use the
-- DescribeWhatIfAnalysis operation.
--
-- You can\'t delete a what-if analysis while any of its forecasts are
-- being exported.
