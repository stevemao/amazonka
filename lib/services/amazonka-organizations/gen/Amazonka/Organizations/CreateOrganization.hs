-- Creates an Amazon Web Services organization. The account whose user is
-- calling the @CreateOrganization@ operation automatically becomes the
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_getting-started_concepts.html#account management account>
-- of the new organization.
--
-- This operation must be called using credentials from the account that is
-- to become the new organization\'s management account. The principal must
-- also have the relevant IAM permissions.
--
-- By default (or if you set the @FeatureSet@ parameter to @ALL@), the new
-- organization is created with all features enabled and service control
-- policies automatically enabled in the root. If you instead choose to
-- create the organization supporting only the consolidated billing
-- features by setting the @FeatureSet@ parameter to
-- @CONSOLIDATED_BILLING\"@, no policy types are enabled by default, and
-- you can\'t use organization policies
