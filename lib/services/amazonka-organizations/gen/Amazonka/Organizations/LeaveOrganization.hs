-- Removes a member account from its parent organization. This version of
-- the operation is performed by the account that wants to leave. To remove
-- a member account as a user in the management account, use
-- RemoveAccountFromOrganization instead.
--
-- This operation can be called only from a member account in the
-- organization.
--
-- -   The management account in an organization with all features enabled
--     can set service control policies (SCPs) that can restrict what
--     administrators of member accounts can do. This includes preventing
--     them from successfully calling @LeaveOrganization@ and leaving the
--     organization.
--
-- -   You can leave an organization as a member account only if the
--     account is configured with the information required to operate as a
--     standalone account. When you create an account in an organization
--     using the Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the
--     information required of standalone accounts is /not/ automatically
--     collected. For each account that you want to make standalone, you
--     must perform the following steps. If any of the steps are already
--     completed for this account, that step doesn\'t appear.
--
--     -   Choose a support plan
--
--     -   Provide and verify the required contact information
--
--     -   Provide a current payment method
--
--     Amazon Web Services uses the payment method to charge for any
--     billable (not free tier) Amazon Web Services activity that occurs
--     while the account isn\'t attached to an organization. Follow the
--     steps at
--     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_remove.html#leave-without-all-info To leave an organization when all required account information has not yet been provided>
--     in the /Organizations User Guide./
--
-- -   The account that you want to leave must not be a delegated
--     administrator account for any Amazon Web Services service enabled
--     for your organization. If the account is a delegated administrator,
--     you must first change the delegated administrator account to another
--     account that is remaining in the organization.
--
-- -   You can leave an organization only after you enable IAM user access
--     to billing in your account. For more information, see
--     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/grantaccess.html#ControllingAccessWebsite-Activate Activating Access to the Billing and Cost Management Console>
--     in the /Amazon Web Services Billing and Cost Management User Guide./
--
-- -   After the account leaves the organization, all tags that were
--     attached to the account object in the organization are deleted.
--     Amazon Web Services accounts outside of an organization do not
--     support tags.
--
-- -   A newly created account has a waiting period before it can be
--     removed from its organization. If you get an error that indicates
--     that a wait period is required, then try again in a few days.
