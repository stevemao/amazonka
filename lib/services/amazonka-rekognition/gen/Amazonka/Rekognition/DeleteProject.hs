-- Deletes an Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels project. To delete a project
-- you must first delete all models associated with the project. To delete
-- a model, see DeleteProjectVersion.
--
-- @DeleteProject@ is an asynchronous operation. To check if the project is
-- deleted, call DescribeProjects. The project is deleted when the project
-- no longer appears in the response. Be aware that deleting a given
-- project will also delete any @ProjectPolicies@ associated with that
-- project.
--
-- This operation requires permissions to perform the
-- @rekognition:DeleteProject@ action.
