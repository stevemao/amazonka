-- Disconnect a Recovery Instance from Elastic Disaster Recovery. Data
-- replication is stopped immediately. All AWS resources created by Elastic
-- Disaster Recovery for enabling the replication of the Recovery Instance
-- will be terminated \/ deleted within 90 minutes. If the agent on the
-- Recovery Instance has not been prevented from communicating with the
-- Elastic Disaster Recovery service, then it will receive a command to
-- uninstall itself (within approximately 10 minutes). The following
-- properties of the Recovery Instance will be changed immediately:
-- dataReplicationInfo.dataReplicationState will be set to DISCONNECTED;
-- The totalStorageBytes property for each of
-- dataReplicationInfo.replicatedDisks will be set to zero;
-- dataReplicationInfo.lagDuration and dataReplicationInfo.lagDuration will
-- be nullified.
