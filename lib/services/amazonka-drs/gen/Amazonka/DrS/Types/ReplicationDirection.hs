-- | Replication direction designates if this is a failover replication, or a
-- failback replication. When a DRS agent is installed on an instance, the
-- replication direction is failover. In cases where a recovery launch was
-- made in the recovery location and a new recovery instance was created,
-- and then a failback replication was initiated from that recovery
-- instance back to the origin location, then the replication direction
-- will be failback.
