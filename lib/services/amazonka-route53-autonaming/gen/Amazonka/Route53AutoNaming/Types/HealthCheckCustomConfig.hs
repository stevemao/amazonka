-- | A complex type that contains information about an optional custom health
-- check. A custom health check, which requires that you use a third-party
-- health checker to evaluate the health of your resources, is useful in
-- the following circumstances:
--
-- -   You can\'t use a health check that\'s defined by @HealthCheckConfig@
--     because the resource isn\'t available over the internet. For
--     example, you can use a custom health check when the instance is in
--     an Amazon VPC. (To check the health of resources in a VPC, the
--     health checker must also be in the VPC.)
--
-- -   You want to use a third-party health checker regardless of where
--     your resources are located.
--
-- If you specify a health check configuration, you can specify either
-- @HealthCheckCustomConfig@ or @HealthCheckConfig@ but not both.
--
-- To change the status of a custom health check, submit an
-- @UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus@ request. Cloud Map doesn\'t monitor
-- the status of the resource, it just keeps a record of the status
-- specified in the most recent @UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus@ request.
--
-- Here\'s how custom health checks work:
--
-- 1.  You create a service.
--
-- 2.  You register an instance.
--
-- 3.  You configure a third-party health checker to monitor the resource
--     that\'s associated with the new instance.
--
--     Cloud Map doesn\'t check the health of the resource directly.
--
-- 4.  The third-party health-checker determines that the resource is
--     unhealthy and notifies your application.
--
-- 5.  Your application submits an @UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus@
--     request.
--
-- 6.  Cloud Map waits for 30 seconds.
--
-- 7.  If another @UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus@ request doesn\'t
--     arrive during that time to change the status back to healthy, Cloud
--     Map stops routing traffic to the resource.
--
-- /See:/ 'newHealthCheckCustomConfig' smart constructor.
